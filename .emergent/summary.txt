The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Mewayz application from an initial MVP to a feature-rich enterprise suite. Key achievements include migrating the backend to Laravel/PHP with MySQL, implementing core CRUDs, and integrating professional features like Stripe payments, ElasticMail, and Google OAuth. The frontend underwent significant refactoring and bug fixes, notably resolving a critical checkbox interaction issue. A professional landing page was established as the default view. Subsequent major additions involved completing a comprehensive 6-step onboarding wizard and implementing Quick Action Tiles for Instagram management and Link-in-Bio features, followed by enhanced Payment and Email UI integrations. Throughout the process, the engineer adeptly resolved various environmental issues (PHP not found, MariaDB connectivity) and application-level bugs (frontend compilation errors, Laravel routing 502 errors). The current immediate focus, after repeated 502 errors related to the preview URL and frontend access, is to provide comprehensive documentation of the massive project as explicitly requested by the user, who expressed confusion due to project complexity.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project aims to be a multi-platform (React web, Flutter mobile/desktop) enterprise business suite, offering integrated solutions for social media, e-commerce, CRM, and email marketing. The backend is Laravel/PHP with MySQL. Key requirements include a robust multi-factor authentication system (Email/Password, OAuth 2.0, 2FA, Biometric, Magic Links, Enterprise SSO), a multi-workspace system with role-based access, and a Stripe-integrated three-tier subscription model. Specific modules include Social Media Management (Instagram API, scheduling), Link in Bio builder, E-commerce, Courses & Community, Website Builder, Booking, Analytics, and a Template Marketplace. A comprehensive 6-step onboarding wizard for new users (Goal, Feature, Team, Subscription, Branding, Dashboard Customization) and an enhanced invitation system are also specified. The platform must adhere to high performance (<200ms API, <3s page load), 99.9% uptime, scalability, mobile optimization, security (AES-256, TLS 1.3, SOC 2, GDPR, RBAC, audit logging), and PWA standards.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed several major feature implementations, addressing various technical challenges along the way.

**Key achievements include:**
1.  **Core Feature Integration:** Successfully integrated Stripe payments, ElasticMail for welcome emails, and Google OAuth. This involved creating , , and integrating  in . Frontend updates included new service files (, ) and refactoring .
2.  **Bug Fixes & UX Enhancements:** A critical checkbox interaction bug in  (specifically in ) was identified and fixed, allowing correct toggling and link navigation. Google OAuth buttons were seamlessly integrated into login and registration forms.
3.  **Professional Landing Page:** A new  was created, showcasing the application, and successfully set as the default root route, providing a polished initial preview.
4.  **Workspace Invitation System:** The backend implementation (migrations, models, controller, routes, email template, Laravel service) was completed and passed all tests.
5.  **Multi-Step Onboarding Wizard (6 steps):** All six steps (, , , , , ) were fully implemented, along with a new  for state management and an  orchestrator. Frontend tests confirmed perfect functionality across all steps.
6.  **Quick Action Tiles:** Implemented a central  and specific quick action modules for  and . These provide immediate, actionable business tools after onboarding. New UI components like  were created for a professional look.
7.  **Enhanced Payment & Email UI Integration:** A  for revenue/subscription/transaction management and an  for email campaigns/templates/analytics were developed.

**Immediate focus and challenges at the point of this summary request:**
The AI engineer successfully resolved backend  not found errors, MariaDB  issues, and database migration problems. A persistent HTTP 502 error on the preview URL, initially diagnosed as a Laravel routing issue and fixed (redirecting root to frontend's ), re-emerged as a blank page problem. The AI attempted to troubleshoot this by checking the  in backend  (which was found to be hardcoded to , contradicting earlier rules and leading to an edit that should not have happened, as frontend's env is ). Despite these attempts, the external preview URL was still problematic. The user then explicitly requested comprehensive documentation of the entire project due to its perceived complexity, which is the immediate task being worked on.

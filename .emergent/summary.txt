The previous AI engineer successfully brought the Mewayz application from inception to a highly functional state. Initial work focused on backend migration from Supabase to Laravel/PHP with MySQL, resolving significant UUID vs. bigint database migration conflicts. After establishing a robust authentication system, the engineer systematically implemented comprehensive CRUD operations for core modules like Workspaces, Social Media, Link in Bio, CRM, Courses, and Products. A critical phase involved integrating the React frontend with the new Laravel backend, requiring extensive refactoring of frontend services (AuthContext, API client, Workspace service) away from Supabase. The engineer meticulously debugged and fixed several authentication flow issues, including state management, redirects, and form interactions, ultimately declaring the application production-ready. The most recent work involved enhancing the application with professional features: Stripe for payments, ElasticMail for email, and Google OAuth for authentication. This process involved integrating playbooks, installing dependencies, modifying database schemas, and updating both backend controllers and frontend services. The engineer is currently debugging a checkbox interaction issue within the registration form.

The Mewayz project is envisioned as a multi-platform business suite for comprehensive management, targeting React for the web application and Flutter for mobile/desktop. Its core purpose is to provide integrated solutions for social media, e-commerce, CRM, and email marketing. Initially, the backend was to be Node.js, but it was explicitly switched to Laravel/PHP with MySQL. Key functional requirements include a robust multi-platform authentication system supporting Email/Password, OAuth, 2FA, and Biometric authentication. A multi-workspace system with role-based access is crucial, along with a Stripe-integrated three-tier subscription model. Specific modules to be developed comprise Social Media Management (including Instagram API integration and scheduling), a Link in Bio builder, E-commerce capabilities, Courses & Community features, a Website Builder, Booking functionalities, comprehensive Analytics, and a Template Marketplace. So far, the core authentication, workspace management, and foundational CRUD for all mentioned modules are implemented in the backend, with frontend integration and professional enhancements (payments, email, Google OAuth) underway.

<pending_tasks>
- Address persistent external MySQL database connectivity issues (currently using a local MariaDB instance).
- Complete implementation of all Laravel backend API endpoints for Mewayz features (this was largely done during the trajectory, but may need minor refinements).
- Implement specific features for the Quick Action tiles (e.g., detailed Instagram API integration, advanced Link Builder features, Course Creator content management, Store Manager inventory/order management, CRM Hub detailed analytics).
- Resolve potential visual or functional issues identified during frontend testing (currently debugging checkbox interaction).
- Finalize frontend integration for Google OAuth, payment processing, and email services within the UI.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on implementing professional-grade enhancements to the Mewayz application, including Stripe for payment processing, ElasticMail for email services, and Google for OAuth authentication.

The backend now has:
- Payment integration:  library installed (), ,  and  models created, migrations run, and corresponding API routes added to  (including a public webhook).
- Google OAuth:  installed, Google OAuth configured in ,  updated with Google OAuth logic (, ), routes added to . The  table migration was updated to include  and  fields, and migrations were re-run.
- Email API:  created in , and  was updated to utilize this service for sending welcome emails upon user registration.

The frontend now has:
- Necessary dependencies for Google OAuth () and Stripe (, ) installed.
- New services created in :  and  for interacting with the new backend features.
- The  has been extensively refactored and simplified to correctly handle user state updates after login/signup, integrating directly with the Laravel backend's response format and removing redundant profile fetching. Logout functionality was also fixed.
- The registration form ( and ) was updated to use the real authentication service, and some unused state/props were cleaned up.
- Frontend testing has confirmed that the backend integration for these new features is largely functional (76.9% to 85% success rate in recent tests), but some frontend state management and visual issues persist, particularly with the  and a checkbox interaction within the .

The engineer is currently debugging an issue related to the checkbox component within the registration form, specifically checking the  component, after observing potential click interception issues due to nested anchor tags in its labels. This is the immediate problem being addressed to achieve full frontend functionality for the professional enhancements.

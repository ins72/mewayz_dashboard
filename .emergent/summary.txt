The previous AI engineer successfully established the Mewayz platform from an MVP to a feature-rich application, focusing on a comprehensive full-stack architecture. Initially, the work involved creating robust backend APIs and integrating them with both React and Flutter frontends for features like Template Marketplace, Advanced Analytics, Gamification, and Team & Role Management. A recurring challenge involved frontend build issues (casing, cache), consistently resolved with  and restarts. The user then requested thorough documentation updates, which the AI engineer delivered by generating a detailed , API, feature, and project status reports. Following this, the user confirmed the existing implementation and requested to continue based on best practices and specifically to fill the gaps related to the 6-step Workspace Setup Wizard and Feature-Based Subscription System, which the user initially believed were fully done. The engineer undertook extensive backend bug fixes, particularly addressing permission logic, JSON formatting, and a significant Stripe integration, including database schema updates and environment variable configuration. Most recently, the focus shifted to frontend integration, connecting React wizard components to the new backend APIs, and implementing real-time features using Laravel Reverb. This involved adding WebSocket dependencies, creating event classes, broadcasting events from backend controllers, and developing frontend real-time services and hooks, alongside resolving numerous frontend import and export errors. The trajectory concludes with the engineer still in the process of fixing frontend component issues.

<product_requirements>
Mewayz is an all-in-one business platform integrating social media, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. Its vision includes a scalable, mobile-first, data-driven architecture with flexible workspace management. Core features include a Link in Bio Builder, Course Creation, E-commerce Management, CRM, Marketing Hub, and a comprehensive mobile application. The platform features a critical 6-step workspace setup wizard for user onboarding, alongside Advanced Analytics, Gamification, and a Template Marketplace. Advanced Analytics provides cross-platform metrics and real-time reporting, Gamification includes achievement systems and progress tracking, and Team & Role Management offers granular permission controls. The previous engineer successfully implemented the Template Marketplace and laid the foundation for Analytics, Gamification, and Team & Role Management. The current focus involves completing and refining the 6-step workspace setup wizard, integrating the feature-based subscription system (with /.50 per feature pricing), connecting frontend components to these backend systems, and implementing real-time features using WebSockets.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was tasked with Frontend Integration: Connect the React wizard components to the new working backend APIs and Real-time features using the Laravel Reverb.

Current work has progressed as follows:
1.  **Frontend API Integration for Workspace Wizard:** The  and  files have been significantly modified. Mock API calls for the 6-step workspace setup wizard (e.g., , , , , , , ) and subscription management (, , , , , , ) have been replaced with actual calls to the backend APIs.
2.  **Laravel Reverb (WebSocket) Implementation:**
    *   **Backend:** Laravel Reverb has been configured in  and its environment variables added to . New Laravel Event classes (, , ) were created. The  was updated to broadcast  events during  and , and the  was updated to broadcast  events in its  method.
    *   **Frontend:** The necessary  and  dependencies were added to , and Reverb environment variables to . A new  was created for WebSocket connections, and a  React hook was implemented to abstract real-time functionality.
3.  **Frontend Component Fixes (Ongoing):** During frontend testing, several build errors related to import casing and export methods were identified in React components and contexts. The AI engineer has been systematically fixing these, including:
    *   : Fixed export statements.
    *   : Confirmed fixes already applied.
    *   : Fixed import/export issues.
    *   : Fixed import/export issues.
    *   : Confirmed import casing fixes.
    *   : Confirmed import casing fixes.
The last action in the trajectory was to check  for similar fixes, indicating that this task of frontend refactoring for correct imports/exports across the codebase is still in progress.

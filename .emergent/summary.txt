The previous AI engineer successfully established the Mewayz application's frontend using React 18 with Vite, Tailwind CSS, Redux Toolkit, and Supabase for backend and authentication. Key features like the Dashboard, Authentication System, Multi-Step Workspace Setup Wizard, and Design System were implemented, adhering to the detailed product specification. However, a significant pivot occurred when the user explicitly requested a complete backend rebuild using Laravel/PHP with MySQL, overriding the existing Supabase setup.

The engineer then transitioned to setting up the Laravel backend. This involved installing PHP and Composer, creating a new Laravel project, configuring Laravel Sanctum for API authentication, and generating numerous database migrations for all Mewayz features. Persistent connectivity issues with the provided external MySQL database led to a strategic decision to establish a local MariaDB instance for development. After resolving migration conflicts related to  table ID types (bigint vs. UUID), the database was successfully migrated. The current challenge involves ensuring the Laravel API routes are properly configured and handling authentication/user model interactions, as testing  endpoints still returns an error page.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project is a comprehensive multi-platform business suite for managing social media, courses, e-commerce, CRM, email marketing, and more. It requires a React web application and Flutter applications for mobile and desktop. The backend was initially specified as Node.js with Express.js/NestJS, MySQL, JWT authentication, Stripe, ElasticEmail, Socket.IO, and AWS S3. A critical design system with specific color palettes and typography was provided. Core features include Social Media Management (Instagram API, scheduling), Link in Bio, CRM & Email Marketing, E-commerce, Courses & Community, Website Builder, Booking, Analytics, and a Template Marketplace. The platform needs a multi-platform authentication system (Email/Password, Google OAuth, Apple/Microsoft Sign-In, 2FA, Biometric) and a multi-workspace system with role-based access. A three-tier subscription model integrated with Stripe is also required. The user explicitly requested to switch the backend to Laravel/PHP with MySQL, providing new MySQL credentials.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: Laravel (PHP), Express.js (Node.js - initially attempted), MariaDB (local MySQL), MySQL (external - connectivity issues), Laravel Sanctum (API Authentication), Composer.
- **Database**: MySQL 8.0+, Supabase PostgreSQL (initial setup).
- **Authentication**: JWT, Supabase Auth (initial), Laravel Sanctum, OAuth, Biometric.
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO.
- **Payment**: Stripe.
- **Email**: ElasticEmail.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application has a monorepo-like structure with distinct  (React) and  (Laravel/PHP) directories.

**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Modified multiple times to configure MySQL/MariaDB connection details (, , , , ) and later updated with external MySQL credentials again.
- : Updated to include  and other Laravel dependencies.
- : Modified to explicitly load  for API routes. This file is crucial for Laravel's application bootstrapping and routing configuration.
- : Created to define API endpoints. This file is where all RESTful API routes for the backend will be registered.
- : Multiple migration files were created (e.g., , , , etc.). These files define the database schema for all Mewayz features, initially had  conflicts, and were later adjusted to correctly reference the existing  table's  ID type.
- : Modified to potentially integrate  and  traits for Laravel Sanctum and UUID handling.
- : Created and modified to handle authentication logic (though the specific implementation details are not fully visible in the trajectory, it was identified as needing login/register methods).
- : A temporary script created to diagnose and test database connectivity issues directly.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Complete implementation of Laravel backend API endpoints for all Mewayz features.
- Address the persistent external MySQL database connectivity issues (currently using a local MariaDB instance).
- Implement full authentication logic within the  and integrate it with Laravel Sanctum.
- Integrate the React frontend with the new Laravel backend using the defined API contracts.
- Implement specific features for the Quick Action tiles (Instagram, Link Builder, Course Creator, Store Manager, CRM Hub, Analytics).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on setting up the Laravel backend and establishing a functional database connection.

Current State:
1.  **Backend Framework**: The application's backend has been successfully migrated from a Supabase-dependent setup to a Laravel (PHP) application.
2.  **Dependencies**: PHP and Composer are installed, and Laravel's core dependencies, including Laravel Sanctum, are in place.
3.  **Database**: A local MariaDB instance has been successfully installed and started. The Laravel application is currently configured to connect to this local MariaDB (, ). All necessary database migrations for the Mewayz features have been successfully run after resolving initial conflicts (related to the  table and UUID vs. bigint ID types).
4.  **Models and Controllers**: Basic models and controllers have been generated for most of the core features and for authentication.
5.  **API Routes**: The  file has been created and configured in  to load correctly.
6.  **Server Status**: The Laravel development server is running on .
7.  **Current Problem**: The immediate task is debugging an error when trying to access the  endpoint. The server returns a Laravel error page, indicating an issue within the application's authentication middleware or a mismatch in expected data types, specifically concerning the uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) field in the  table (UUID vs. integer expectation in relationships/authentication).
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Diagnose and fix the uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root) field type mismatch issue in the  table or the authentication flow to enable functional API access.

The previous AI engineer successfully launched the Mewayz application, migrating the backend from Supabase to Laravel/PHP with MySQL and establishing a consistent UUID-based database. Core CRUD operations for various modules were implemented. Recent efforts focused on integrating professional features like Stripe payments, ElasticMail for emails, and Google OAuth, alongside extensive frontend refactoring and bug fixes, including a critical checkbox interaction issue. A professional landing page was also created and set as the default view. Currently, the engineer is in the process of implementing a comprehensive workspace invitation system and the multi-step onboarding wizard. The immediate challenge involves resolving persistent frontend compilation errors and addressing database indexing problems that arose during recent migrations.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project aims to be a multi-platform (React web, Flutter mobile/desktop) enterprise business suite, offering integrated solutions for social media, e-commerce, CRM, and email marketing. The backend is Laravel/PHP with MySQL. Key requirements include a robust multi-factor authentication system (Email/Password, OAuth 2.0, 2FA, Biometric, Magic Links, Enterprise SSO), a multi-workspace system with role-based access, and a Stripe-integrated three-tier subscription model. Specific modules include Social Media Management (Instagram API, scheduling), Link in Bio builder, E-commerce, Courses & Community, Website Builder, Booking, Analytics, and a Template Marketplace. A comprehensive 6-step onboarding wizard for new users (Goal, Feature, Team, Subscription, Branding, Dashboard Customization) and an enhanced invitation system are also specified. The platform must adhere to high performance (<200ms API, <3s page load), 99.9% uptime, scalability, mobile optimization, security (AES-256, TLS 1.3, SOC 2, GDPR, RBAC, audit logging), and PWA standards.

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure, containing distinct  (React) and  (Laravel/PHP) directories.



- : Updated with MySQL/MariaDB connection details, Stripe, ElasticMail, Google API keys, and . Essential for external service configuration and cross-service communication.
- : Expanded to include routes for authentication (Google OAuth), core modules (Workspaces, Social Media, CRM, Courses, Products), PaymentController, and newly added Workspace Invitation and Invitation Batch routes. This centralizes API endpoint definitions.
- : Modified existing and added new migrations to ensure UUID consistency across tables (, , , etc.). New migrations were created for , , , , and database performance optimization/indexing. These define the database schema and support features.
- : Updated to use UUIDs, added  and  columns, and defined relationships for various modules like .
- : Manages user authentication, including , , , , password reset, and the new Google OAuth flow (, ). Utilizes  for welcome emails.
- : New controller for handling Stripe payment processing, including webhook logic.
- : (NEW) Controller managing the new workspace invitation lifecycle (send, accept, manage).
- , : New models to store payment transaction and subscription data.
- , : (NEW) Models defining the structure for workspace invitations and batches.
- : New service encapsulating ElasticMail API calls for sending emails (e.g., welcome emails).
- : (NEW) Service to abstract Laravel-specific invitation logic for reuse in controllers.
- , : (NEW) Middleware for implementing security and performance monitoring across API requests.
- : (NEW) Custom exception handler for centralized API error management.
- : (NEW) Form request for validating invitation creation data.
- : (NEW) Blade template for the workspace invitation email.
- : Modified to add  configuration, important for generating correct links in emails.
- : Refactored to integrate with the Laravel backend, managing user authentication state, login, signup, logout, and now Google OAuth integration.
- : (NEW) Context for managing the state and flow of the multi-step onboarding wizard.
- : New Axios instance configured for API calls to the Laravel backend, handling authorization tokens.
- , , , , : New frontend utility files that encapsulate API calls specific to the Laravel backend for different modules, replacing previous Supabase integrations.
-  & : Modified to use the new  for real authentication and to include the Google OAuth button. The  component within  was specifically fixed to resolve click interception issues related to nested labels.
-  & : Verified to correctly use  and updated to include the Google OAuth button for seamless sign-in.
- : Modified to define application routes, including public landing page, authentication routes, and new routes for  and the various steps of the Onboarding Wizard. It also includes authentication guards for protected routes.
- : (MODIFIED) Critical fix for checkbox interaction, replacing a duplicate label and implementing custom click handling to allow both checkbox toggling and link navigation within its label.
- : (NEW) A reusable React component for displaying the Continue with Google button, integrated into login/registration forms.
- : (NEW) The main marketing landing page for the application, showcasing features and pricing. It's set as the default root route.

<pending_tasks>
- Address persistent external MySQL database connectivity issues.
- Complete implementation of all Laravel backend API endpoints for Mewayz features (minor refinements).
- Implement specific features for Quick Action tiles (e.g., Instagram API, Link Builder, Course Creator, Store Manager, CRM Hub).
- Finalize frontend integration for payment processing and email services within the UI (beyond current basic integration).
- Complete the remaining steps of the 6-step onboarding wizard (Subscription, Branding, Dashboard Customization).
- Resolve frontend compilation errors, specifically JSX syntax issues and module import pathing within new components.
- Fix database indexing issues, particularly the duplicate index error during migrations.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer successfully integrated professional features (Stripe payments, ElasticMail, Google OAuth) and created a professional landing page, which is now the default preview.

**Key achievements:**
- **Backend professional features:**  was installed for payments,  and associated models/migrations (, ) were created, along with API routes.  was integrated for Google OAuth in , including updates to the  table.  was created for welcome emails upon registration.
- **Frontend professional features & bug fix:** Stripe and Google OAuth dependencies were installed. New frontend services (, ) were created.  was refactored for Laravel. Critically, a persistent checkbox interaction issue in  (due to nested labels in ) was identified and fixed, allowing both checkbox toggling and link navigation. Google OAuth buttons were successfully integrated into both login and registration forms, visually confirmed via screenshots.
- **Professional Landing Page:** A new  component was created, showcasing Mewayz features, pricing, and testimonials. It was successfully set as the root route in  and verified as the main preview page.  was updated for professional meta tags.

**Current immediate focus and challenges:**
- The engineer successfully implemented the backend of the **Workspace Invitation System** (migrations, models, controller, routes, email template, Laravel service) with 100% test success.
- The next step was to implement the **6-step onboarding wizard** frontend. The first three steps (, , ) were created, and  was introduced.
- However, the frontend is currently **not compiling or loading correctly**, showing a black screen and console errors related to  (e.g., unescaped ) and  after file restructuring for onboarding components.
- Concurrently, during an attempt to optimize the database for best practices, a migration () failed due to **duplicate indexes**, indicating a need to clean up or correctly apply indexing. The engineer's last action was to drop a problematic migration and create a new one to add only missing indexes.

The system is in a state where core features are functional, new major functionalities (invitation system, onboarding wizard) are partially implemented, and immediate work involves resolving frontend compilation issues and backend database optimization.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the remaining frontend compilation issues preventing the onboarding wizard from rendering, then address the database indexing problems.

The previous AI engineer effectively transitioned the Mewayz application from an MVP state to a more robust, structured, and feature-rich product. Key initial challenges involved correcting a backend technology mismatch (Python/FastAPI to Laravel/PHP) and replacing hardcoded data with dynamic database interactions. The engineer meticulously restructured the entire project, creating dedicated , , and  directories, and ensuring file consistency. Significant progress was made on enhancing user onboarding via a comprehensive 6-step workspace setup wizard and integrating a dynamic dashboard with analytics and gamification. The current focus, prompted by the user's all request, is a massive feature enhancement, deepening the capabilities of core modules like advanced analytics, Instagram management, and Link in Bio. Lingering ESLint issues are noted but not prioritized over functional delivery.

The Mewayz application is a comprehensive business platform integrating social media, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. The user tasked the previous AI engineer with:
1.  **Project Scope Documentation**: Creation of detailed reports outlining the application's functionality and technical stack (Laravel 12, React 18, MariaDB) – *Completed*.
2.  **Hardcoded Data Removal**: Replacing static data with dynamic fetches from the database across both backend (new controllers, models, routes, migrations) and frontend (new services, contexts, component updates) – *Largely completed*.
3.  **Tech Stack Consistency**: Ensuring no duplicated technologies, specifically removing Supabase dependencies where Laravel backend suffices – *Addressed in *.
4.  **Documentation Update**: Comprehensive updates to all project documentation, including API, developer, database, deployment, security, user, and feature guides – *Completed, organized into a new  directory*.
5.  **Project Restructuring**: Reorganizing files for a more professional and consistent project structure, including creation of  and  top-level directories – *Completed*.
6.  **Enhanced Workspace Setup Wizard**: Implementing a detailed 6-step onboarding wizard covering welcome, goal selection, feature selection, subscription, team setup, and branding configuration – *Completed*.
7.  **Dashboard Integration & Analytics/Gamification**: Connecting the dashboard to display dynamically configured features/goals, and building a comprehensive analytics and gamification system – *Completed*.
8.  **Comprehensive Feature Enhancement**: Implementing all core platform features (Instagram Management, Link in Bio Builder, Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub), supporting systems (Template Marketplace, Payment & Subscription, Team & Role Management), and advanced features (Admin Dashboard, Mobile Optimization, Advanced Analytics), with a current focus on *deepening* their capabilities – *In progress*.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture, now well-organized into distinct top-level directories:



**Key Files and Their Importance/Changes:**
-   : Initially misconfigured to run Python, now ensures Laravel PHP backend runs.
-   : New controllers (e.g., , ) and modifications to existing ones (, ) to serve dynamic data.
-   : New models (e.g., , ) were created for database persistence.
-   : Updated to register and expose new API endpoints for backend functionalities.
-   : This entire directory was newly created, and all original frontend files from  were moved here to centralize the React application.
-   : Moved from , this file now holds frontend environment variables, crucially .
-   : Many new service files (e.g., , , , , , ) were created or enhanced to encapsulate API calls and retrieve dynamic data.  was explicitly enhanced for advanced features.
-   : Utility files like , ,  were created.  was modified to remove the  dependency, aligning with the tech stack consistency goal.
-   , : React Contexts introduced to manage and provide dynamic data throughout the application, especially for workspace and the setup wizard.
-   : A newly created main component that orchestrates the comprehensive 6-step user onboarding wizard.
-   : A new page component responsible for integrating the dynamic dashboard, displaying configured goals/features, and analytics.
-   : A new React component implemented to display gamification elements like achievements, progress indicators, and leaderboards.
-   : A new React component for the Instagram management UI.
-   : This new directory was created to centralize all project documentation, replacing previously scattered Markdown files in the root.
-   : A new document created to comprehensively detail the final, restructured project layout.

<pending_tasks>
-   Resolve persistent ESLint linting errors reported during frontend file modifications.
-   Configure API keys for remaining third-party integrations (e.g., Google OAuth, ElasticMail), beyond the existing Stripe setup.
-   Conduct comprehensive end-to-end testing of the complete 6-step workspace wizard flow and the integrated dashboard system.
-   Continue the massive feature enhancement across all core platform features (Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, Marketing Hub).
-   Implement supporting systems (Template Marketplace, Payment & Subscription, Team & Role Management).
-   Implement advanced features (Admin Dashboard, Mobile Optimization).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in a MASSIVE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT initiative, aiming to deepen the functionality of all core Mewayz platform features as per the user's recent all request.

The work is structured in phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Enhanced Dashboard - Advanced Analytics & Intelligence**: The engineer started by creating  to build out more sophisticated analytics capabilities for the dashboard.
2.  **Phase 2: Instagram Management - AI-Powered Content & Advanced Analytics**: The engineer proceeded to create  and  to begin implementing advanced Instagram management features, including AI-powered content and detailed analytics.
3.  **Phase 3: Link in Bio Builder - Advanced Drag-and-Drop & A/B Testing**: The engineer noted that  already existed and was in the process of enhancing it to incorporate advanced drag-and-drop and A/B testing functionalities.

This current work directly follows the successful implementation of the enhanced 6-step workspace setup wizard and the dynamic dashboard integration with analytics and gamification, ensuring a seamless and feature-rich user experience from onboarding to daily operations. The focus is now on building out and enriching the core business functionalities of the platform.

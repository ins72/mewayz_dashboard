The previous AI engineer successfully established the Mewayz application, transitioning from an MVP to a structured full-stack solution. Initial work focused on migrating from Python/FastAPI to Laravel/PHP, eliminating hardcoded data with dynamic database interactions, and restructuring the codebase into , , , and  directories. Key features implemented include a comprehensive 6-step workspace setup wizard and a dynamic dashboard with analytics and gamification. The massive feature enhancement initiative began by deepening core capabilities. Phase 1 (Link in Bio Builder) involved creating a drag-and-drop interface with A/B testing. Phase 2 (Course Creation) focused on comprehensive course management. During these phases, the engineer resolved critical backend issues related to PHP and Composer installations. Phase 3 completed the E-commerce Management system, adding product, inventory, and order functionalities. The current work, Phase 4, involves developing the CRM system, with initial frontend components and service enhancements complete, and the focus shifting to backend API integration. Persistent ESLint warnings were noted but not prioritized over functional delivery.

The Mewayz application aims to be an all-in-one business platform integrating social media, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing. The previous AI engineer's mandate included:
1.  **Project Scope Documentation**: Creation of detailed functional and technical reports (completed).
2.  **Hardcoded Data Removal**: Replacing static data with dynamic database interactions across frontend and backend (largely completed).
3.  **Tech Stack Consistency**: Eliminating redundant technologies like Supabase where Laravel suffices (addressed).
4.  **Documentation Update**: Comprehensive updates across all project areas, organized in a new  directory (completed).
5.  **Project Restructuring**: Reorganizing files into , , and  top-level directories (completed).
6.  **Enhanced Workspace Setup Wizard**: Implementing a detailed 6-step user onboarding process (completed).
7.  **Dashboard Integration & Analytics/Gamification**: Connecting the dashboard to dynamically configured features and building analytics/gamification (completed).
8.  **Comprehensive Feature Enhancement**: Deepening capabilities of core modules like Instagram Management, Link in Bio Builder, Course Creation, E-commerce, CRM, and Marketing Hub (in progress). The current trajectory shows successful implementation of Link in Bio Builder, Course Creation, and E-commerce.

Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in the MASSIVE FEATURE ENHANCEMENT initiative, having successfully completed Phase 1 (Link in Bio Builder) and Phase 2 (Course Creation System), and Phase 3 (E-commerce Management System).

The current focus is on **Phase 4: CRM System Implementation**, as recommended and approved by the user. The work done so far for the CRM system includes:
-   **Frontend Service Enhancement**: The existing  was reviewed and subsequently enhanced to include comprehensive CRM functionality.
-   **Frontend Component Creation**:
    -    was created as the main CRM management interface.
    -    was created for sales pipeline visualization and management.
    -    was created to display customer communication history.
-   **Backend Integration (In Progress)**: The next immediate step is to integrate these CRM functionalities with the backend by adding the necessary routes to  and creating/enhancing associated controllers. This process began with the engineer attempting to add CRM routes to the backend.

The backend infrastructure has been stabilized, with PHP 8.2 and Composer installed, and all services (, , ) confirmed as running. Frontend syntax errors encountered during previous phases have been resolved.

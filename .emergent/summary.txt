The AI engineer's trajectory reveals a systematic approach to expanding the Mewayz application. Initially, foundational work focused on migrating to Laravel/PHP, enhancing the workspace wizard, and establishing a dynamic dashboard. A significant massive feature enhancement initiative followed, successfully completing Phase 1 (Link in Bio Builder), Phase 2 (Course Creation), Phase 3 (E-commerce Management), and Phase 4 (CRM System). During CRM implementation, a critical PHP installation issue was identified and resolved. Most recently, Phase 5 (Marketing Hub Enhancement) was successfully integrated, followed by the complete development of a new, comprehensive Flutter mobile application following best practices, which includes placeholder features for all major Mewayz modules. Persistent ESLint warnings were noted but not addressed as a priority. The overall work demonstrates robust feature development and architectural expansion.

The Mewayz application is envisioned as an all-in-one business platform, integrating social media, e-commerce, CRM, and marketing capabilities. The previous AI engineer's core mandate included:
1.  **Project Scope Documentation**: Creation of detailed functional and technical reports.
2.  **Hardcoded Data Removal**: Transitioning from static data to dynamic database interactions across the stack.
3.  **Tech Stack Consistency**: Eliminating redundant technologies where Laravel provided sufficient functionality.
4.  **Documentation Update**: Comprehensive updates across all project areas, organized in a new  directory.
5.  **Project Restructuring**: Reorganizing files into , , and  top-level directories.
6.  **Enhanced Workspace Setup Wizard**: Implementing a detailed 6-step user onboarding process.
7.  **Dashboard Integration & Analytics/Gamification**: Connecting the dashboard to dynamically configured features and building analytics/gamification.
8.  **Comprehensive Feature Enhancement**: Deepening capabilities of core modules. This initiative involved multiple phases, including Link in Bio Builder (Phase 1), Course Creation (Phase 2), E-commerce Management (Phase 3), CRM System (Phase 4), and Marketing Hub (Phase 5). The mobile application development was a recent, explicit request for expanding platform accessibility.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer successfully completed Phase 5: Marketing Hub Enhancement. This involved creating comprehensive backend models (, , , , ) and a  with over 10 API endpoints. Corresponding database migrations were created and run, and the backend was thoroughly tested, achieving a 96.7% success rate. On the frontend, a new  and  page were created, and relevant routes were added to  and .

Following the Marketing Hub completion, the user explicitly requested the creation of a native mobile app in Flutter. The AI engineer proceeded to build a comprehensive Flutter application from scratch. This involved:
-   Setting up the basic project structure and .
-   Implementing a Clean Architecture across  with dedicated , , and  layers.
-   Developing a complete authentication system (login, register, forgot password) with JWT support.
-   Setting up a robust routing and navigation system using , including protected routes.

The previous AI engineer successfully initiated the Mewayz application, establishing a React frontend with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Redux Toolkit. A critical pivot involved rebuilding the backend from an initial Supabase setup to Laravel/PHP with MySQL. This involved extensive environment setup, including installing PHP, Composer, and MariaDB locally due to external MySQL connectivity issues. The engineer meticulously resolved numerous database migration conflicts, primarily stemming from a UUID vs. bigint ID type mismatch across the  table, various foreign key relationships (, , ), and the  table. After achieving a fully functional and tested authentication system, the focus shifted to implementing core business logic within controllers and models. The work concluded with an Unmatched } syntax error when testing workspace endpoints, suspected to be in the  model.

<product_requirements>
The Mewayz project is a multi-platform business suite for comprehensive management, including social media, e-commerce, CRM, and email marketing. It targets a React web application and Flutter mobile/desktop apps. The backend, initially proposed as Node.js, was explicitly switched to Laravel/PHP with MySQL. Key features demand a robust multi-platform authentication system (Email/Password, OAuth, 2FA, Biometric), a multi-workspace system with role-based access, and a Stripe-integrated three-tier subscription model. Specific modules include Social Media Management (Instagram API, scheduling), Link in Bio, E-commerce, Courses & Community, Website Builder, Booking, Analytics, and a Template Marketplace.

<key_technical_concepts>
- Frontend: React 18, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS.
- Backend: Laravel (PHP), MariaDB (local MySQL), Laravel Sanctum (API Authentication), Composer.
- Authentication: UUIDs, JWT, OAuth, 2FA, Biometric.
- Integrations: Stripe, ElasticEmail.
- Real-time: Socket.IO.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application employs a monorepo structure, containing distinct  (React) and  (Laravel/PHP) directories.



**Key Files and Changes:**
- : Critical for environment configuration. Updated to include MySQL/MariaDB connection details and newly provided Stripe and ElasticMail API keys (, , ).
- : Essential for Laravel's application bootstrapping. Configured to explicitly load  for API routes.
- : Defines API endpoints. Contains routes for authentication (, , , ) and initial  routes. This is where all backend API routes are registered.
- : Defines the  table schema. **Modified** from  to  to ensure UUID primary keys, aligning with the  model. Also adjusted  table  to .
- : Defines the  table used by Laravel Sanctum. **Modified** from  to  to support UUIDs for the polymorphic relationship .
- : Multiple migration files (, , , , , , ). These were extensively **modified** to change , , , and  columns to  types, ensuring consistency with the  table's UUID primary key.
- : Eloquent model for users. **Modified** to remove the programmatic UUID generation in the  method (as UUID generation is now handled in the migration) and added relationships like . A temporary  method was introduced and then fixed.
- : Handles authentication logic. Contains , , , and  methods which are now functional.
- : Controller for workspace management. **Created/Implemented** with placeholder or basic CRUD methods (, , , , ).
- : Eloquent model for workspaces. **Created/Implemented** with relationships (e.g., , ).
- : Eloquent model for workspace members. **Created/Implemented** with relationships (e.g., , ).

<pending_tasks>
- Address persistent external MySQL database connectivity issues (currently using a local MariaDB instance).
- Complete implementation of all Laravel backend API endpoints for Mewayz features beyond authentication and basic workspace.
- Integrate the React frontend with the new Laravel backend using the defined API contracts.
- Implement specific features for the Quick Action tiles (Instagram, Link Builder, Course Creator, Store Manager, CRM Hub, Analytics).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on building out the core backend infrastructure after successfully migrating from Supabase to Laravel/PHP and resolving extensive database migration issues.

Current State:
1.  **Backend Framework**: Laravel is fully set up and running.
2.  **Dependencies**: PHP 8.2 and Composer are installed and verified.
3.  **Database**: A local MariaDB instance is successfully installed, running, and accessible by the Laravel application. All database tables and their relationships have been successfully migrated using UUIDs for primary and foreign keys after resolving numerous  vs.  type mismatches across almost all migration files, including , , , , , , , , and .
4.  **Authentication**: The core authentication system (, , ) is fully implemented and has been successfully tested, returning valid tokens and user data. Laravel Sanctum is configured correctly for API token authentication.
5.  **Core Feature Development**: Work has begun on the  module. The ,  model, and  model have been created and partially implemented with relationships.
6.  **Current Problem**: The immediate task involves debugging a syntax error (Unmatched }) encountered when attempting to test the newly implemented workspace endpoints, with the  model being the suspected source of the issue. The  file was also created after the authentication system was verified.

# Test Results for Mewayz Application

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Test all API endpoints for authentication, workspace management, and core features
- Verify database connections and migrations
- Test API response formats and error handling

### Frontend Testing
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- MUST stop to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for frontend testing
- Test UI components, authentication flow, and user interactions

### User Feedback Integration
- READ user feedback carefully
- NEVER fix something that has already been fixed by testing agents
- Address only legitimate issues reported by testing agents
- DO NOT waste time on minor cosmetic issues unless critical

## Current Status

### Backend Implementation Status
- ✅ Laravel backend setup complete
- ✅ Database migrations successful with UUID support
- ✅ Authentication system (Laravel Sanctum) implemented
- ✅ API endpoints for authentication working:
  - POST /api/auth/register - User registration
  - POST /api/auth/login - User login
  - GET /api/auth/user - Get authenticated user
  - POST /api/auth/logout - User logout
- ✅ Database schema created for all features:
  - Users, Workspaces, Workspace Members
  - Social Media Accounts, Social Media Posts
  - Link in Bio Pages, CRM Contacts
  - Courses, Course Modules, Course Lessons, Course Enrollments
  - Products, Subscriptions, Features, Workspace Features
- ✅ API keys configured in .env:
  - Stripe keys (secret and public)

### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Complete implementation of all API endpoints (workspaces, social media, etc.)
- [ ] Implement business logic for each feature
- [ ] Create controller methods for CRUD operations
- [ ] Test frontend integration with Laravel backend
- [ ] Implement specific features for Quick Action tiles

## Testing Results

### Backend Testing
- Authentication endpoints tested successfully
- User registration working with UUID generation
- Login/logout functionality operational
- Token-based authentication via Laravel Sanctum working

### Issues Fixed
- ✅ UUID vs bigint ID mismatch in database migrations
- ✅ Foreign key constraint issues in workspace and related tables
- ✅ personal_access_tokens table compatibility with UUID users
- ✅ Database connection and migration conflicts resolved

### Current Database State
- Local MariaDB instance running successfully
- All migrations completed without errors
- UUID-based primary keys implemented correctly
- Foreign key relationships established properly

## Next Steps
1. Test all implemented backend endpoints
2. Implement remaining API endpoints for features
3. Integrate frontend with new Laravel backend
4. Test end-to-end application functionality

# Test Results for Mewayz Application

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Test all API endpoints for authentication, workspace management, and core features
- Verify database connections and migrations
- Test API response formats and error handling

### Frontend Testing
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- MUST stop to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for frontend testing
- Test UI components, authentication flow, and user interactions

### User Feedback Integration
- READ user feedback carefully
- NEVER fix something that has already been fixed by testing agents
- Address only legitimate issues reported by testing agents
- DO NOT waste time on minor cosmetic issues unless critical

User remains on login screen despite successful authentication. This indicates AuthContext state management issue where successful login response is not properly updating user state or triggering navigation. Backend returns success but frontend AuthContext.signIn() may not be returning success:true to trigger navigation in LoginForm.handleSubmit(). ⚠️ MINOR ISSUES: Registration form checkbox interactions have UI overlay issues (labels intercepting clicks), but core functionality appears intact.

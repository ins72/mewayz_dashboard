# Test Results for Mewayz Application

## Testing Protocol

### Backend Testing
- MUST test BACKEND first using `deep_testing_backend_v2`
- Test all API endpoints for authentication, workspace management, and core features
- Verify database connections and migrations
- Test API response formats and error handling

### Frontend Testing
- ONLY test frontend if user asks to test frontend
- MUST stop to ask the user whether to test frontend or not
- Use `auto_frontend_testing_agent` for frontend testing
- Test UI components, authentication flow, and user interactions

### User Feedback Integration
- READ user feedback carefully
- NEVER fix something that has already been fixed by testing agents
- Address only legitimate issues reported by testing agents
- DO NOT waste time on minor cosmetic issues unless critical

## Current Status

### Backend Implementation Status
- ✅ Laravel backend setup complete
- ✅ Database migrations successful with UUID support
